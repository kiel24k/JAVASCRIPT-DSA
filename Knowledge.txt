Data structure - A data structure is a specific way of organizing, storing, and accessing data.

Algorithm - A set of instruction that tells a computer how to do something, or you can also step-by-step solution of the problem is called algorithm

iterate means loop

Big O - Big O notation helps us understand how long an algorithm will take to run or how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows.

//O(n) - aka constant time, signifies that the execution time of an algorithm remains constant regardless of the input size

//O(Log n) - O(log n) time complexity refers to an algorithm's runtime that grows logarithmically with the size  of the input (represented by n). In simpler terms, as the input size increase slowly.
